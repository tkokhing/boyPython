# ABOUT THE PROJECT

## BACKGROUND 

1.	The project is to define a SSL grading system. To accomplish this, the project explored into using APIs from SSL Labs and defined its own grading methodology. 

## PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATIONS

2.	**_Choice of Industry with Polarity_**.   This should be representative from various industry categories. It must be on _both ends of the polarity so that to have good contrast_.

3.	**_Redefine the Existing Graders_**.   There are existing SSL Graders, notably SSLLabs by Qualys. However, grading scale is blackbox, thus _refinement to allow better differentiate the gradings_.

## COUNTRY AND INDUSTRY FOR STUDY

4.	The selected industries were chosen as they each have their own unique characteristics ( **bold** in Table 1). Within each industry, the polarities, positive and negative, were provided to guide the selection of websites  so that to provide contrast for deeper analysis. 


S/N | Industry | Characteristic |  Polarity (+ve)   |   Polarity (–ve) 
---|---|---|---|---
1| Academia – University | University is the **cream of the crop in technology**. It will be interesting to find the otherwise and weaknesses in their websites. | Top rankings by independent studies. | Low rankings from the same independent studies.
2| Healthcare | The healthcare industry is **vital to any country** with **information on individuals**, thus there should be much emphasis to maintain the industry websites. | Newsweek reports rankings on hospitals.  | Hospitals in rural districts, bad records with high incidents.
3| Arts – Museums | This is **not a high revenue earning industry but age-old**, thus may have fall behind the technology trend leaving their websites more prone to vulnerabilities.  | Reputation, high visitorship and size. | Old museums, rural districts and smaller in scale.
4| Banking | Banks are of **high value and transactions**, thus should system in placed to upkeep against vulnerabilities. | Forbes rankings on banks with big earnings. | Forbes worst banks, banks in rural districts, small-scale, privately owned banks.
